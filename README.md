## Tools For a Great Day

[Surface Laptop 3](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/surface-laptop-3/8vfggh1r94tm?activetab=techspecs) - I'm not a huge hardware guy but I have really enjoyed this machine. I have a red one for my work at MLevel and one in blue for all my other projects. Sleek, mac-like experience with Windows as the OS. 13.5” 16GB LPDDR4x RAM, Quad-core 10th Gen Intel® Core™ i7-1065G7 Processor, 512GB SDD, with the Alcantara® material. It's not the most cost efficient set up but with a 10 hour battery life and slim profile, it's great for my work-from-wherever style.
