# Hi, I'm John

Software Engineer at [MLevel](https://mlevel.com/), an industry learing learning development platform. 

## What I use

I'm using C# with .NET Core and .NET Framework, doing front end in Angular with scss, storing data in SQL Server and CosmoDB, and hosting on Azure. Maintaining legacy code in Knockout, jQuery, PHP, Wordpress, and more. I have varied degrees of experience using Ruby on Rails, Python, React, Xamarin, Docker, Kubernetes, Laravel, MongoDB, MySQL, Drupal, Selenium, and about a million other tools. 

Occasionally dabbling in IoT, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Data Science, and some more "computer sciencey" areas but largely focused on leveraging tech to make  really awesome products for people to use. 

Mainly interested in Solutions Architecture, DevOps, Front End Development, Product Development, User Experience, Data Analysis, and many other areas that help SaaS companies scale their technology. 


## Tools For a Great Day

[Surface Laptop 3](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/surface-laptop-3/8vfggh1r94tm?activetab=techspecs) - 
    I'm not a huge hardware guy but I have really enjoyed this machine. I have a red one for my work at MLevel and one in blue for all my other projects. Sleek, mac-like experience with Windows as the OS. 13.5” 16GB LPDDR4x RAM, Quad-core 10th Gen Intel® Core™ i7-1065G7 Processor, 512GB SDD, with the Alcantara® material. It's not the most cost efficient set up but with a 10 hour battery life and slim profile, it's great for my work-from-wherever style.
