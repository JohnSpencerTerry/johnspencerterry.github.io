When everything shut down this time last year and the once taut nets were replaced with makeshift chair borders and loose twine (take the net away and they’ll still play, we discovered), I was trying to coordinate a match between myself and an Emory grad student for my T2 flex league. We couldn’t work out a court that wasn’t shut down and, frankly, neither of us were sure playing would be responsible. 

Since then, it’s just been a few sparse pre-beer games with Zach, my college buddy who was really the driving force behind me getting into the sport. Normally, he wins. But during our last few matchups, I’ve taken the lead and felt much more in control of the game, the rate of play, and my movements. Maybe something the slow pace of pandemic life has given me increased concentration. 

Anyways, it’s spring and perfect weather for tennis. 

I think I have some vague goals for this season but, my primary goal is to return to the sport after a year hiatus. I’m going to include a few tennis courts near where I live in Atlanta (near Cabbagetown). Honestly, I think most public tennis courts in Atlanta are subpar; however, there’s a few around me that I like. For paid tennis courts, I like Bitsy Grant on Northside and Sandy Springs Tennis Center on Abernathy, though both are a bit of a hike for me.
