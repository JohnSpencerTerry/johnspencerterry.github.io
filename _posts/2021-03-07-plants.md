My girlfriend, Crystal, is starting a new job tomorrow. It’s her first B2B, corporate style role and she’s going to be remote, so obviously a big change. We had to scramble to find a desk. We got a dusty chair from the abandoned MLevel office. My Dad gave her a whiteboard and a heavy pen because, everyone needs a nice pen on their desk. He was shocked when I disclosed, I hadn’t used a stapler in nearly a decade.  


To take her mind off any first day Sunday scaries and brighten up our apartment, we spent the afternoon getting some new house plants and planting some herb seedlings. 


I’ve had some herbs in pots on the porch since last spring. Most of them, as expected, died in the late summer Georgia heat, or were killed in the frosts that came around October. I was able to salvage a rosemary that I ignored and hoped to bring life back to it. In addition, there are two flowers of unknown variety and a display of succulents that were forced to seek refuge on the porch after our new kitten discovered them. We went to a local plant store, Gardenhood, where we found four nice indoor plants – three of which are sitting on Crystal’s desk and one for our living room area.
